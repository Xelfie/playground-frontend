# Playground - Frontend

A React project made for fun and learning. We have started the learning right off the bat by creating the project with Vite, and trying out Tailwind for styling!

## Setup

Run `npm install`.

## Run the project

The following command will run the project in watch mode:

```
npm run dev
```

## Find and fix lint issues

- `npm run lint` will look for lint issues in the whole project.
- `npm run lint:fix` will fix all issues that can be automatically fixed by the IDE.
